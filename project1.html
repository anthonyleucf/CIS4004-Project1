            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                This was my final project for CAP4630 (Artificial Intelligence) with Dr. Liqiang Wang. 
                In this reinforcement learning assignment, I trained an AI-based explorer to find 
                the optimal path to some treasure (denoted T) by moving either left or right. The 
                treasure was located to the right, so the explorer had to figure this out through 
                trial and error, gradually improving its decisions and reducing the number of steps 
                needed in each iteration. As shown in the pictured code snippet and related output, 
                the model initially reached the treasure in 34 steps, but after a dozen episodes, it 
                learned and was able to reduce this number to 5.
